# Learning Stye Personality Test

[My Trello!](https://trello.com/b/zuRs0iur/project-mvps)

*Approval Confirmed!*

## ***Description***

In this rigourous course, I have found that I have constantly needed to adapt and be prepared to learn in several different ways to fit my needs to understand the material. What if I told you that in the ways that I have helped myself to learn more information, I can help anyone struggling to understand the best way that can to intake new information. There are 7 classified learning types (visual, aural, verbal, physical, social, and solitary). The goal of my project will help people classify their unique learning style! I will have up to 20 detailed introspective questions in a fun, interactive, and educational web development project! Details below.

### ***Personality Quiz***
**Goals and Potential Ideas** 

This particular project may make use of up to 30+ html pages! The user will answer up to 20 questions. Each instance of an answer will navigate to a following similar html webpage and the game will add up all the answers a player inputs and select a personality based on their answers at the end! At the beginning of the quiz there will be a title screen demonstrating the kind of quiz it is and whether they would like to continue. At the end of the quiz it will reveal results based on a score tallied and that will have its own formatting depending on how I decide to lay out the information.


*Objectives:*

- [] Event Listeners for each instance to navigate to the following webpage and for it to track answers 
- [] Beautiful professional design! I wanted to work on making good styling for this particular project
- [] Logic for selecting personalities based off of answers chosen
- [] A progress bar at the top letting player know how much further they are along in the quiz

*Posible Ideas:*
- [] Dark mode event listener which will affect ALL html pages 
- [] Hover effect on answers that will make the design look more stylized
- [] Links at the end that allow user to share their personality on social media! 

*To be updated as further changes occur..*
