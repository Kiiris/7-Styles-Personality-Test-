    <h2 class="quote">"We are here not only to realize the truth of our being but to express it. If we realize who we are but still move from fear or a sense of obligation or cultural expectation, then the realization has not yet integrated into the whole of life." - Author: Dhyana Stanley</h2>
    <p>Visual learning refers to a mode of learning where students rely on graphic aids to remember and learn material. Visual learners can easily visualize objects, have a great sense of balance and alignment, are very color-oriented and can effortlessly envision imagery. Visual learners learn best by color-coding their notes, making to-do lists and using concept maps to organize their thoughts.</p>

    <h2>In Software Development...</h2>
    <p>Visual learners love their text editors because most editors use color to consistently indicate specific code. Try mimicking that process by taking notes in color, specifically on new vocabulary words. Creating wireframes is a great way to visually conceptualize your development projects. Choose coding resources that were created with diagrams and images. A good visual resource is The Ultimate Flexbox Cheat Sheet. The positioning of the images with the color blocking in this Cheat Sheet makes learning Flexbox more accessible.</p>
