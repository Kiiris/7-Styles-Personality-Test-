    <p>Students who prefer auditory learning over tactile or visual will be focused on listening instead of seeing, reading, or physically trying in order to learn. Auditory learners like to hear things in order to process the information best, which is often a good option for classroom learning.</p>

    <p>Auditory learners best understand content through listening and speaking in situations such as lectures and group discussions. Think audio books, podcasts, lectures etc. Aural learners use repetition as a study technique and benefit from the use of mnemonic devices. There is so much vocabulary we need pick up as new coders. Auditory learners have the advantage of benefitting from hearing them being used.</p>
