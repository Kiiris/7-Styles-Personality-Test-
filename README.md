# Calvin Menyfield's 2nd Project Plan 
*Awaiting approval from 3 different ideas*

## ***Plan 1***

***
## ***Checkers***

Goals and Potential Ideas
***

This is my possibly my most complicated plan (in theory). I would start by making an 8x8 board with alternating colors using css. Pieces would be set up inside and I would create event listeners for pieces with div classes that has logic for how they are able to move. This game will be two players. Pieces should be able to double jump, turn into Kings, and the game ends when either one side is unable to move, or all of the opponents pieces are captured.

*Objectives:*

- [] 8x8 grid with panel on other side of the board which has additional functionalies 
- [] Panel on other side includes reset button, scoreboard, and/or alerts to players if the other side has won or when one side has made a King. 
- [] Game logic for preventing pieces from moving in places they are unable to in the rules
- [] Game logic for double jumping in cases it's allowed and for Kings movement to be different from normal piece movement
- [] Event handlers for ending a game when it is supposed to end

*Posible Ideas:*
- [] Clicking on a piece hovers over its possible moves (including double jumps)
- [] Styling effects that make div pieces slightly animate upon moving
- [] Sound effects whenever a piece moves to a square on the board         
## ***Plan 2***

***
## ***Hangman***
Goals and Potential Ideas 
***
I was thinking of creating a hangman game. My css would have 3 areas. A center where the words are supposed to be located and guessed, below that where there would be a grid for a keyboard which has all clickables, and on one side of that a scoreboard where your score is tracked how you know whether you've lost or won. The "panel" for this game would tell you a prompt as a hint to what you're guessing, let you know a score, and tell you how many guesses you have left. If you win or lose, there should be a reset button that changes to a different word or phrase. 

*Objectives:*

- [] Many combitions of words/phrases that correspond to a prompt on the panel which can be called randomly by the a reset button
- [] The words should update based on the letters clicked and the panel should indicate to the player how many guesses they have remaining
- [] If a player has won the game there should be a message indicating they won. Likewise if they lost they should no longer be able to continue playing

*Posible Ideas:*
- [] Dark mode event listener
- [] Letters clicked to be greyed out or in red
- [] Sounds and special effects!

## ***Plan 3***

***
### ***Personality Quiz***
Goals and Potential Ideas 
***
Finally, I wanted to make a personality quiz of my choosing. This particular project may make use of up to 30+ html pages! This single player game will have 20 or more questions. Each instance of an answer will navigate to a following similar html webpage and the game will add up all the answers a player inputs and select a personality based on their answers at the end! 


*Objectives:*

- [] Event Listeners for each instance to navigate to the following webpage and for it to track answers 
- [] Creating at least 20 questions and 10 different personalites based off questions chosen
- [] Logic for selecting personalities based off of answers chosen
- [] A progress bar at the top letting player know how much further they are along in the quiz

*Posible Ideas:*
- [] Dark mode event listener which will affect ALL html pages 
- [] Hover effect on answers that will make the design look more stylized
- [] Links at the end of results and beggining of a page that allow user to share their personality on social media!
